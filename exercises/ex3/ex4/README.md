# Exercise 4 - A look under the hood of the application with application logging and the Kibana dashboard

As long as your application works properly... but what if that isn't the case?

SAP Business Technology uses the application logging service to provide developers and administrators with not only CLI access to log output but also a Kibana dashboard for logging and monitoring purposes.

When something goes wrong with an application, developers usually use the Cloud Foundry CLI to directly analyze the log output. However, because you cannot filter or similar, the data is unstructured and massive. The SAP BTP Kibana dashboard offers numerous ways to gain insights into your SAP BTP applications.

## Exercise 3.1 Navigate to Kibana Dashboard
## Exercise 3.2 Filter for your application
## Exercise 3.3 Get used to dashboards
## Exercise 3.4 Check logs for incoming events, API Reads and SAP HANA Cloud access
